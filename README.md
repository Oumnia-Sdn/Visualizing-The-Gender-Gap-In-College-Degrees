# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees

This small project has the purpose of showing how the gender gap in college behaved in the past years, comparing courses from different areas from the year of 1968 until 2011. The data was taken from The Department of Education Statistics and can be found [here](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp). Since this project was designed to be published, it uses the pallet [Color Blind 10](https://tableaufriction.blogspot.ro/2012/11/finally-you-can-use-tableau-data-colors.html), from Tableu, to show the graphs in colors easy to identify by everyone.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. The data set can be download [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv).
